\title{Demonstration of DBSCAN on toy datasets}
\usage{
demo_blobs()

demo_circles()
}
\value{
There are two parts:
\itemize{
\item Printed summary table of clustering results: number of clusters generated (excluding noise),
and the four validation metrics used in \code{summary()}: connectivity, mean silhouette width, Dunn index,
and CDbw.
\item Scatter plots of the data, with generated clusters displayed as different colours.
}
}
\description{
Applies DBSCAN to 2-D toy datasets and displays the results. \code{blobs} represents points collected into
two clearly-separated approximately-globular clusters, and \code{circles} represents points collected into
two hollow  circles inside each other. Three different algorithms will be fitted into the dataset,
each with different \code{min_pts} and \code{eps} parameters, clustering summaries printed, and scatter plots
drawn to display the resulting clusters to demonstrate the impact of the different parameters.
