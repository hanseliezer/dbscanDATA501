\description{
Prints summary statistics for clusters generated by \code{dbscan}.
}
\details{
There are three sections to the summary:
\itemize{
\item Parameters used in algorithm fitting.
\item Clustering results: total fitting time in seconds and number of clusters generated (excluding noise).
\item Clustering quality: results of four internal validation metrics, and a description of what should
be aimed for in terms of value:
\itemize{
\item Connectivity
\item Mean silhouette width
\item Dunn index
\item CDbw (composed density between and within clusters)
}
}
\subsection{On quality metrics}{

Care must be taken in using connectivity, mean silhouette width and Dunn index metrics to assess the
quality of clusters generated by density-based clustering. These metrics have an underlying assumption
that the generated clusters are approximately globular in shape, whereas density-based algorithms such as
DBSCAN are capable of generating arbitrarily-shaped clusters (Moulavi et al. 2014).
