\usage{
dbscan(
  data,
  eps,
  min_pts,
  metric = "euclidean",
  normalise = TRUE,
  border_pts = TRUE
)

is_core_point(data, eps, min_pts, metric = "euclidean", normalise = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataset or distance matrix to be clustered.}

\item{eps}{Maximum distance in which to find \code{min_pts} neighbours to form a cluster.}

\item{min_pts}{Minimum number of points required to be found within \code{eps} distance to form a cluster.}

\item{metric}{Distance metric. Defaults to \code{euclidean}, other options are \code{manhattan} and
\code{precomputed}. If \code{precomputed}, \code{data} must be a distance matrix.}

\item{normalise}{Logical; whether to normalise \code{data} before fitting. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{border_pts}{Logical; whether "border points" should be included in a cluster.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{dbscan()} returns a list object of class \code{dbscanDATA501} with the following components:

\item{dataset }{Dataset being clustered.}
\item{eps }{Value of \code{eps} parameter used.}
\item{min_pts }{Value of \code{min_pts} parameter used.}
\item{metric }{Distance metric used.}
\item{normalise }{Whether dataset is normalised prior to fitting.}
\item{border_pts }{Whether border points are clustered.}
\item{cluster_labs }{Integer vector indicating cluster membership. Noise points are assigned 0.}
\item{fitting_time }{Total algorithm fitting time in seconds.}

\code{is_core_point()} returns a logical vector indicating whether each observation in the dataset would be
considered a core point under the given \code{eps} and \code{min_pts} parameters.

Applies the DBSCAN algorithm to a given dataset.

\details{
The most critical parameters to choose are \code{min_pts} and \code{eps}. The higher the numbers, the higher the
bar is for a cluster to be initiated. The best values will be dependent on the dataset itself
and domain knowledge, and it is recommended to try a few different combinations of values before
proceeding with analysis. A proposed heuristic to get an initial \code{min_pts} guess is dataset
dimensionality multiplied by 2, while a starting value for \code{eps} can be found by constructing a sorted
\eqn{k}-distance plot based on a chosen \code{min_pts} and finding the "valley" (Sander 1998).

The choice of \code{metric} is also problem-dependent. If neither Euclidean and Manhattan distances are
appropriate, a custom distance matrix can always be calculated before supplying it to the function
and specifying \code{metric = precomputed}.

If dataset is not yet normalised, it is highly recommended to set \code{normalise = TRUE}, or normalise
the data first separately. As a distance-based algorithm, DBSCAN is sensitive to features being on
varying scales.

\code{border_pts=TRUE} means border points - points that do not have sufficient number of neighbours by
itself but are neighbours of a core point - are included in a cluster, and is consistent to the
original algorithm as described by Ester et al. (1996). While \code{FALSE} excludes border points, which
is more consistent to the definition of a cluster having to always have a certain minimum density,
and is equivalent to hierarchical DBSCAN described in Campello et al. (2013).
